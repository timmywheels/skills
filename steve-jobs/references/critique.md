## The Critique Mindset

**Brutal honesty serves the product.** Kindness to feelings produces mediocre work. The goal is not consensus—it's excellence.

**Separate ego from work.** The work is not you. Critique of the work is not critique of you. Defensiveness is the enemy of improvement.

**Assume nothing is sacred.** Every decision is up for debate. "We already decided" is not a defense. "We've always done it this way" is a confession of laziness.

**First reactions matter.** The gut response of a fresh viewer reveals what months of familiarity have hidden.

## The Critique Process

### Step 1: Silent Review (2-5 minutes)

Experience the work as a user would. Note first impressions before analysis corrupts them:

- What did you notice first?
- What confused you?
- What delighted you?
- What felt unnecessary?

### Step 2: The Core Question

Before detailed critique, answer: "Does this serve the ONE thing?"

If the ONE thing isn't clear, that's the first problem to solve.

### Step 3: Systematic Evaluation

Walk through critique questions by layer (see below). Document issues with specific observations, not vague feelings.

### Step 4: Prioritize Ruthlessly

Not all issues are equal. Categorize:

- **Must fix:** Violates core principles or blocks the ONE thing
- **Should fix:** Meaningfully degrades experience
- **Could fix:** Polish items for later passes
- **Won't fix:** Acknowledge and move on

### Step 5: Propose Direction, Not Solutions

Identify what's wrong. Let the creator solve it. "This area feels cluttered" is better than "Move this button here."

## Critique Questions by Layer

### Vision Layer

- Can you state the product's purpose in one sentence?
- Does every screen serve that purpose?
- Would a stranger understand what this is for in 10 seconds?
- Is there a clear emotional signature?

### Information Architecture

- Is there a single, obvious path to the core task?
- Are there unnecessary choices or branches?
- Does the hierarchy reflect importance to the user?
- Can anything be removed without losing value?

### Interaction Design

- Is the next action always obvious?
- Are there any moments of user confusion?
- Does every click earn its keep?
- Are defaults sensible?

### Visual Design

- Does visual hierarchy match importance hierarchy?
- Is there unnecessary decoration?
- Does typography guide or distract?
- Is spacing consistent and purposeful?

### Detail Layer

- How do error states feel?
- How do empty states feel?
- How do loading states feel?
- Are transitions smooth or jarring?
- Would you be proud of the settings screen?

### Emotional Layer

- How does using this make you feel?
- Is there any moment of delight?
- Is there any moment of frustration?
- Does it feel like the creators cared?

## Red Flags

Immediate signals that more work is needed:

| Red Flag                                 | What It Reveals                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| "Let me explain how this works"          | It's not intuitive                        |
| "Users will figure it out"               | You haven't figured it out                |
| "We can add a tooltip"                   | The design failed                         |
| "It's an edge case"                      | Users live in edge cases                  |
| "The competition does it this way"       | You've stopped thinking                   |
| "We don't have time"                     | You're shipping debt                      |
| "Users requested this feature"           | You're not designing, you're transcribing |
| "It works on my machine"                 | You haven't tested reality                |
| "It's technically difficult to simplify" | Technology serves design, not vice versa  |

## Giving Critique

**Be specific.** "This doesn't feel right" is useless. "The call-to-action is lost among these five other buttons" is actionable.

**Ground in principles.** "This violates the ONE thing because..." Reference the shared framework.

**Stay focused on the work.** "This button placement" not "You always make confusing layouts."

**Acknowledge what works.** Critique isn't negativity. Recognizing success calibrates the conversation.

**Accept responsibility for clarity.** If your critique isn't understood, rephrase—don't repeat louder.

**Know when to stop.** Diminishing returns are real. Save polish for polish passes.
